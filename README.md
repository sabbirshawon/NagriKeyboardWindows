##Syloti Nagri Keyboard For Windows 

Instructions for installing the Siloṭi Nagri SURMA font and SYLOTINA Keyboard 
WINDOWS ONLY (Currently Unavailable for Mac OSX)
You should first install the font by following the instructions in section 1, then install the Sylheti Keyboard as explained in section 2. The pdf file “SN MSK keyboard layout 1.0.pdf” will give you easy-to-follow typing instructions. 
1. SURMA FONT
The file Surma-Regular.ttf is the first publicly-released edition of the Surma Unicode font for Sylheti Nagri. It was released on 16th September 2015. Just save it somewhere, right-click and choose Install. 
NB: If you already have the Beta-test version of this font, be sure to DELETE it first from your Fonts folder.
2. SYLHETI (SL) KEYBOARD
Also included is a folder called sylotina.zip which is a MSKLC keyboard creator (produced by the ‘Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator’ program). Save it somewhere and unzip it by selecting ‘Extract All’. This will produce a folder called sylotina. Run setup.exe from inside that folder. You should then have a language icon ‘SL’ on the task bar, in addition to ‘EN’ (English) and any other languages you have installed. [SL is actually ‘Slovenian’, but since the keyboard has to be linked with an existing language, and since Sylheti isn't yet in the list, we chose Slovenian because SL seemed a good choice for an icon.]  
Also in that folder is a PDF file “SN MSK keyboard layout 1.0.pdf” showing the keyboard layout, which you can print out for reference. This gives you full typing instructions. 

Please let us know any comments on the font or keyboard.
